            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India's Supreme Court has agreed this week to hear arguments in a
            challenge to a controversial new forest law. An official request 
            for a hearing was filed to the Supreme Court last October by 13 former
            officials in the forest service and environment ministry, who say the 
            amended Forest Conservation Act is unconstitutional. The next hearing, 
            which is yet to be scheduled, is the latest in a series of protests against 
            the law — which some scientists say makes it easier to clear forests for development 
            and erodes the rights of millions of people who depend on these ecosystems.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M. K. Ranjitsinh Jhala, a former departmental head at the Ministry of Environment 
            and Forests and a co-petitioner in the case says the revised act would harm the ecology 
            of India and the livelihoods of forest-dwelling people. “There’s nothing in that act that 
            we can see is going to help nature conservation, food security, ecological security 
            and livelihood,” he says.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also exempts parcels of land alongside roads and 
            railway lines from development approval. 
            Although the exempt parcels are small, they could add up to a large area: India has more than 
            144,000 kilometres of highways and 123,000 kilometres of tracks.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment has made the steps for obtaining consent from tribal peoples less prescribed. 
            Soumitra Ghosh, a forest-rights activist at the All India Forum of Forest Movements, based 
            in Siliguri, says more flexibility in the approvals process might allow some developers 
            to cut corners in consulting with forest-dwellers. Some 300 million people live in 
            villages bordering forests and directly depend on them, according to the India State 
            of the Forest 2019 report. These include tribal people, some of whom have lived in 
            and around the forests for millennia.
